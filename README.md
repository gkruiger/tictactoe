# tictactoe
Exploring the concept of brute force in AI in my blog: https://www.ontdeksels.nl/tic-tac-toe-doe-je-zo/ (Dutch).

## A game of tictactoe 
in which you play against an brute force AI, which by the way you can never win.
Live demo in my blog.

## A tictactoe simulator
for simulating an X number of tictactoe games between a random/brute force player and a random/brute force player.
Used in my blog to get some statistics.
